# DPatterns

A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.

Basically, design patterns are categorized into two parts:

    1.Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
    2.JEE Design Patterns.

Core Java Design Patterns
In core java, there are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:

1.Creational Design Pattern

    Factory Pattern
    
    Abstract Factory Pattern
    
    Singleton Pattern
    
    Prototype Pattern

    Observer Pattern
    
    State Pattern
    
    Strategy Pattern
    
    Template Pattern
    
    Visitor Pattern

JEE or J2EE Design Patterns
J2EE design patterns are built for the developing the Enterprise Web-based Applications.

In J2EE , there are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:


1. Presentation Layer Design Pattern
    
    Intercepting Filter Pattern
    
    Front Controller Pattern
    
    View Helper Pattern
    
    Composite View Pattern

    Business Delegate Pattern
    
    Service Locator Pattern
    
    Session Facade Pattern
    
    Transfer Object Pattern
    
3. Integration Layer Design Pattern
    
    Data Access Object Pattern
    
    Web Service Broker Pattern
